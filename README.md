## The Golden Rule: 

🦸 🦸‍♂️ `Stop starting and start finishing.` 🏁

If you work on more than one feature at a time, you are guaranteed to multiply your bugs and your anxiety.

## Making a plan

## Home HTML:
-- list of dynamically rendered cars array that link to car information page

## car-detail HTML: 
-- Separate information page that displays more information on selected car

## data.js:
-- contains the car array to be exported to other files

## render-data-utils.js: 
-- contains the renderCar function used to render cars on the home page
-- also contains the findById function to find object in cars array using id of parameter

## car-detail HTML:
-- imports required functions and data to display information to screen
-- sets text content for document elements
-- uses params element
